A simple shell, often referred to as a command-line shell or just shell, is a basic user interface for an operating system that allows users to interact with the system by entering commands. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) where users can type commands, and the shell interprets and executes those commands. The primary purpose of a shell is to act as a command interpreter, taking user input in the form of text commands and then executing those commands by interacting with the operating system.
